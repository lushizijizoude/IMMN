# IMMME
This is the implementation code of the IMMN model.

## Overview
Before executing the project, you need to download our dataset. Wiki4MNED dataset can be download from <a href="https://www.baidu.com"> Wiki4MNED</a>.
The WikilinksNED dataset was generated by  <a href="https://github.com/yotam-happy/NEDforNoisyText"> this project</a>. 
We executed the processing code and got a candidate WikilinksNED dataset. Note that this dataset may be slightly different from the original data set because the version of the Wikipedia dump file we choose may be different as well as other necessary files. Given the huge data scale, this difference can be ignored.
Since the data was large and processing took too much time, we provide an optional processing result <a href="https://www.baidu.com"> here</a>.
